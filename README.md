##Overview

### Site URL
[http://www.bdosono.com/](http://www.bdosono.com/)

### History
This website has advanced through multiple iterations since I've started my graduate program. It started off on Bootstrap and I've continually refactored the code to remove the excess bulk of the Bootstrap framework. See the entire visual progression on my [**Behance**](https://www.behance.net/gallery/38857453/Personal-Website) profile or the [**Internet Archive**](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.bdosono.com/). Below, I will walk through the different kinds of immensely helpful auditing tools I used to develop this site so that other people (particularly under/graduate students) can go the extra mile in optimizing their web presence.

##Design 
### Accessible
Having conducted research ([*Dosono, 2015*](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/soups2015/soups15-paper-dosono.pdf)) with visually-impaired computer users, I wanted to ensure that my website was accessible via screen reader. The [**Wave Accessibility Evaluation Tool**](http://wave.webaim.org/report#/http://www.bdosono.com/) helps me detect any potential problems that may arise among screenreaders.

### Nimble
The site scores a 100% performance rating on both [**Pingdom**](https://tools.pingdom.com/#!/bGotxy/http://www.bdosono.com/) and [**Google PageSpeed**](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bdosono.com%2F). I minimized assets wherever possible (using customized [**Fontello**](http://fontello.com/) font for the social media icons instead of loading small images).

### Reliable
Validating the architectural soundness of the website on [**W3C Markup Validation Service**](https://validator.w3.org/) is a must to ensure the functional integrity of the HTML code. Unecessary CSS can be removed with [**CSS Lint**](http://csslint.net/). [**WooRank**](https://www.woorank.com/) provides excellent suggestions for improving search engine optimization.

### Understandable
_Less is more._ I'm a huge fan of minimal design, which steered me away from incorporating distrating web elements: animations, patterned backgrounds, and meaningless shadows. I found the [**Accessibility Developer Tools**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-developer-t/fpkknkljclfencbdbgkenhalefipecmb) Google Chrome extension to identify unused CSS selectors. The clear call-to-action on the website is the download button. 

### Usable
Responsive design allows for the site content to adjust accordingly for optimal viewing among mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. I use [**Screenfly**](http://quirktools.com/screenfly/#u=http%3A//www.bdosono.com/&w=1024&h=600&s=1) to see how the website looks on screens of varying dimensions.
